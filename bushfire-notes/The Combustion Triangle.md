The **combustion triangle** (also known as the **fire triangle**) is a fundamental model that explains the **three essential elements required for fire**: **heat, fuel, and oxygen**. It is widely used in fire science, firefighting, and bushfire behaviour studies as a conceptual tool to understand ignition, spread, and suppression of fire.

## The Three Elements

### 1. Heat
- Heat provides the **energy required to ignite fuel** and sustain combustion.  
- It raises the temperature of fuel to its **ignition point**, where flammable gases are released.  
- Heat sources can include lightning, sparks, friction, deliberate ignition, or radiant heat from nearby flames.  

Once a fire is burning, heat continues to drive combustion through:
- **Conduction** (heat transfer through solids),  
- **Convection** (heat carried by rising gases),  
- **Radiation** (heat transfer as electromagnetic waves).

### 2. Fuel
- Fuel is the **combustible material** that sustains the fire.  
- In bushfire contexts, fuel includes grasses, leaves, twigs, shrubs, and forest litter.  
- The **quantity, arrangement, and moisture content** of the fuel directly influence fire intensity and spread.  
  - **Dry fuel** ignites more easily and burns more intensely.  
  - **Fine fuels** (e.g. grass, leaves) ignite quickly, while coarse fuels (logs, branches) burn more slowly.

### 3. Oxygen
- Oxygen supports the **chemical reactions of combustion**.  
- The atmosphere contains about **21% oxygen**, which is usually sufficient for fire.  
- Without adequate oxygen, combustion slows or ceases (e.g. smothering a fire with a blanket or foam).

## The Triangle Concept

The combustion triangle shows that **all three components must be present** for a fire to ignite and continue burning:

- **Remove any one element** → the fire goes out.  
- Fire suppression strategies are often based on targeting one or more sides of the triangle:
  - **Remove heat** → apply water or retardant to cool the fire.  
  - **Remove fuel** → create firebreaks or backburns.  
  - **Remove oxygen** → smother the fire (foam, soil, blankets).

## The Fire Tetrahedron

While the triangle explains the basics, modern fire science often extends it to the **fire tetrahedron**, which adds a **fourth component: the chemical chain reaction**. This recognises that combustion is a self-sustaining chemical process once initiated.

The tetrahedron emphasises:
- **Chain reactions** between free radicals and fuel vapours sustain combustion.  
- Some suppression agents (e.g. halons, dry chemical powders) disrupt this chain reaction rather than removing heat, fuel, or oxygen.

## Applications in Bushfire Science

- **Ignition prediction**: Moisture content of fuel determines whether the heat input is enough for ignition.  
- **Fire behaviour modelling**: Models like the **Rothermel spread model** and the **McArthur FFDI** are underpinned by the same principles (availability of fuel, heat input, and oxygen supply).  
- **Suppression strategies**: Firefighters use the triangle as a guide:
  - Cooling with water,  
  - Reducing fuel with hazard reduction burns,  
  - Excluding oxygen in industrial fires with foam or inert gases.

## Summary

The **combustion triangle** is a simple yet powerful model for understanding fire. It highlights that a fire cannot exist without **heat, fuel, and oxygen**. By recognising which side of the triangle to target, both scientists and firefighters can better predict, prevent, and suppress fires.
