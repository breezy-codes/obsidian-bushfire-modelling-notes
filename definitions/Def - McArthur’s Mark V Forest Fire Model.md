McArthur’s Mark V Forest Fire Model (1967) predicts the rate of spread of bushfires in Australian eucalyptus forests using weather and fuel dryness. The operational equation is:

![[Eq - McArthur’s Mark V Forest Fire Model#^fa46fe]]

where $D$ is the drought factor, $H$ relative humidity, $T$ temperature, and $U$ wind speed. The result is expressed in metres per minute. The model underpins the [[McArthur FFDI|Forest Fire Danger Index]] (FFDI) and remains widely used, though it simplifies fuel load and assumes quasi-steady behaviour.
