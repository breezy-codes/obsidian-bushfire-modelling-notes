The **Rothermel model** is one of the most widely adopted mathematical models for predicting the **rate of spread (ROS)** of wild-land fires. Developed in the early 1970s by Richard C. Rothermel of the USDA Forest Service, it represents a **semi-physical, semi-empirical approach** that balances physical principles (such as conservation of energy) with empirical adjustments to account for the complexities of real-world fire behaviour.

- It drew upon earlier efforts by Fransden, who applied conservation of energy to fire spread.  
- It has become one of the most widely adopted fire spread models in the world.  
- It forms the foundation for more sophisticated models, including those that account for coupled fireâ€“atmosphere interactions.

A cross-sectional side view of the fuel bed shows three regions: burned, unburned, and the combustion zone. The volume element $\Delta V$ in the unburned zone moves towards the combustion interface with velocity $R$. The coordinates $(x,z)$ move with the fire front.
