The CSIRO Grassland Fire Spread Model predicts the potential quasi-steady rate of spread (ROS) of grassland fires as a function of pasture type, wind speed, dead-fuel moisture content, and degree of curing. It combines a wind response function, a fuel-moisture coefficient, and a curing coefficient in a multiplicative form:

where $U$ is wind speed, $m$ is dead-fuel moisture, and $C$ is curing. Natural pasture spreads faster than cut/grazed pasture by a factor of 1.18. The model is widely used in Australia for fire behaviour prediction and underpins the grassland fire danger rating system.
