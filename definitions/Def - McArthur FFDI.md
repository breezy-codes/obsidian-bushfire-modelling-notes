The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is an Australian measure of bushfire danger that combines temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a drought factor into a single value. It reflects how difficult a forest fire would be to control under given conditions. The index is calculated as:

where $\text{DF}$ is the drought factor, $H$ relative humidity, $T$ temperature, and $V$ wind speed. Higher values indicate greater fire danger, with thresholds defining ratings from *Lowâ€“Moderate* to *Catastrophic*.
