Byram’s Fireline Intensity quantifies the energy output of a fire front per unit length, defined as:

$$I = H \, w \, R$$

where $H$ is heat yield (kJ/kg), $w$ fuel consumed in the flaming zone (kg/m²), and $R$ the rate of spread (m/s). The result is expressed in kilowatts per metre ($\text{kW/m}$). Higher intensities correspond to taller flames, more severe fire behaviour, and greater suppression difficulty, with values above 4,000 kW/m considered extreme.
