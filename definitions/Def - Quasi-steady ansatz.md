The quasi-steady ansatz refers to the assumption that the rate of spread of a fire can be expressed as a mathematical function of the environmental variables.  

We denote the quasi-steady rate of spread by  

![[Eq - Quasi-steady ansatz#^7444b8]]  

where:  
- $R$ is the quasi-steady rate of spread.  
- $f$ is the function defining the model.  
- $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are the variables representing the fire environment (e.g. wind, fuel, slope).  

Key ideas:  
- The rate of spread is uniquely determined by the environmental factors.  
- If the environmental factors are not changing, the quasi-steady rate of spread $R$ will remain constant.  
- A model that satisfies this assumption is referred to as a quasi-steady model.  

Thus, the quasi-steady ansatz provides a way to link measurable or controllable environmental conditions directly
